# dynatrace Cookbook

This Chef cookbook installs and configures the Dynatrace Application Monitoring solution.

## Requirements

Requires Chef 11 or higher.

## Recipes

### default

Installs the Dynatrace Server. Please refer to the `server` Chef Recipe below.

### agents_package

*Installs the Dynatrace Agents package.*

Download the Dynatrace Agents package from [downloads.dynatrace.com](http://downloads.dynatrace.com) and place the artifact as `dynatrace-agents.jar` in the cookbook's `files` directory. Alternatively, you can make the installer available as an *HTTP* or *FTP* resource and point the Chef Recipe to the right location via the `node['dynatrace']['agents_package']['linux']['installer']['file_url']` attribute. Please refer to `attributes/agents_package.rb` for a list of supported attributes. In order to have the Chef Recipe executed, include `recipe[dynatrace::agents_package]` in a runlist.

**Note:** this recipe merely makes the Dynatrace Agents available, but it does not configure your application to actually load any. See the `java_agent` recipe for an example that does.

### apache_wsagent

*Installs the Dynatrace WebServer Agent for the Apache HTTP Server.*

Download the Dynatrace WebServer Agent installer from [downloads.dynatrace.com](http://downloads.dynatrace.com) and place the artifact as `dynatrace-wsagent.tar` in the cookbook's `files` directory. Alternatively, you can make the installer available as an *HTTP* or *FTP* resource and point the Chef Recipe to the right location via the `node['dynatrace']['wsagent_package']['linux']['installer']['file_url']` attribute. Please refer to `attributes/apache_wsagent.rb` and `attributes/wsagent_package.rb` for a list of supported attributes. In order to have the Chef Recipe executed, include `recipe[dynatrace::apache_wsagent]` in a runlist.

**Note:** you will have to restart the web server after placing the agent. You should also make sure that the Apache HTTP service is started only after the Dynatrace WebServer Agent service to maintain a correct startup order whenever the machine under management gets rebooted. Currently, this can be automated for systems that start the Apache HTTP server via an [LSB init script](http://refspecs.linuxbase.org/LSB_3.0.0/LSB-generic/LSB-generic/iniscrptact.html) in `/etc/init.d` via the `node['dynatrace']['apache_wsagent']['apache']['do_patch_init_script']` and related attributes in `attributes/apache_wsagent.rb`.

### collector

*Installs the Dynatrace Collector.*

Download the Dynatrace Collector installer from [downloads.dynatrace.com](http://downloads.dynatrace.com) and place the artifact as `dynatrace-collector.jar` in the cookbook's `files` directory. Alternatively, you can make the installer available as an *HTTP* or *FTP* resource and point the Chef Recipe to the right location via the `node['dynatrace']['collector']['linux']['installer']['file_url']` attribute. Please refer to `attributes/collector.rb` for a list of supported attributes. In order to have the Chef Recipe executed, include `recipe[dynatrace::collector]` in a runlist.

### java_agent

*Installs the Dynatrace Agent Java Agent.*

Download the Dynatrace Agent package from [downloads.dynatrace.com](http://downloads.dynatrace.com) and place the artifact as `dynatrace-agents.jar` in the cookbook's `files` directory. Alternatively, you can make the installer available as an *HTTP* or *FTP* resource and point the Chef Recipe to the right location via the `node['dynatrace']['agents_package']['linux']['installer']['file_url']` attribute. Please refer to `attributes/java_agent.rb` and `attributes/agents_package.rb` for a list of supported attributes. In order to have the Chef Recipe executed, include `recipe[dynatrace::java_agent]` in a runlist.

**Note:** this recipe makes the Java Agent available to a Java Virtual Machine by injecting an appropriate `-agentpath` option into an environment variable, e.g. `JAVA_OPTS`, inside a file (typically an executable script). It is assumed that this script either executes the Java process directly or is sourced by another script before the Java process gets executed. You will have to restart the application after placing the agent.

### server

*Installs the Dynatrace Server.*

Download the Dynatrace Server installer from [downloads.dynatrace.com](http://downloads.dynatrace.com) and place the artifact as `dynatrace.jar` in the cookbook's `files` directory. Alternatively, you can make the installer available as an *HTTP* or *FTP* resource and point the Chef Recipe to the right location via the `node['dynatrace']['server']['linux']['installer']['file_url']` attribute. Please refer to `attributes/server.rb` for a list of supported attributes. In order to have the Chef Recipe executed, include `recipe[dynatrace::server]` in a runlist.

### wsagent_package

*Installs the Dynatrace WebServer Agent package.*

Download the Dynatrace WebServer Agent package from [downloads.dynatrace.com](http://downloads.dynatrace.com) and place the artifact as `dynatrace-wsagent.jar` in the cookbook's `files` directory. Alternatively, you can make the installer available as an *HTTP* or *FTP* resource and point the Chef Recipe to the right location via the `node['dynatrace']['wsagent_package']['linux']['installer']['file_url']` attribute. Please refer to `attributes/wsagent_package.rb` for a list of supported attributes. In order to have the Chef Recipe executed, include `recipe[dynatrace::wsagent_package]` in a runlist.

**Note:** this recipe merely makes the Dynatrace WebServer Agent available, but it does not configure your web server to actually load it. See the `apache_wsagent` recipe for an example that does.
