The default download link can be overridden via the `node['dynatrace']['agents_package'][$platform]['installer']['file_url']` attribute. Alternatively, you can place the installer artifact as `dynatrace-agent.jar` (Linux) or as `dynatrace-agent.msi` (Windows) in the cookbook's `files` directory from where it will be picked up during the installation.

**Note:** this recipe makes the Java Agent available to a Java Virtual Machine by injecting an appropriate [-agentpath](https://community.compuwareapm.com/community/display/DOCDT65/Java+Agent+Configuration) option into an environment variable, e.g. `JAVA_OPTS`, inside a file (typically an executable script). It is assumed that this script either executes the Java process directly or is sourced by another script before the Java process gets executed. You will have to restart the application after placing the agent.

**Note:** it is only possible to inject one agent on one machine using this recipe. To inject more agents it is possible to use the `resources/java_agent.rb` resource which sets the `node['dynatrace']['java_agent']['javaopts'][$agent_name]` with options to be passed to the JVM (e.g. `-agentpath:/opt/dynatrace/agent/lib64/libdtagent.so=name=BusinessBackend_easyTravel,server=dynasprint-collector.dynatracesaas.com:9998`).

## Testing

We use [Test Kitchen](http://kitchen.ci) to automatically test our automated deployments with [Serverspec](http://serverspec.org) and [RSpec](http://rspec.info/):

1) Install Test Kitchen and its dependencies from within the project's directory:

```
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

2) Run all tests

```
kitchen test
```

By default, we run our tests inside [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers as this considerably speeds up testing time (see `.kitchen.yml`, requires Ruby 2.2+). Alternatively, you may as well run these tests in virtual machines based on [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) (see `.kitchen.vagrant.yml`).

## Platforms
